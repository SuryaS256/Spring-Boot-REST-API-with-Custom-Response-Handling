# Spring-Boot-REST-API-with-Custom-Response-Handling
-Developed a robust CRUD REST API using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL, supporting create, read, update, and delete operations on user data.
-Implemented a standardized JSON response structure (data, responseCode, responseMessage) across all endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using a generic DTO for consistent client handling.
-Integrated business rules such as duplicate user detection, not-found checks, and meaningful HTTP status codes with structured messages for improved error handling and API usability.
